# MVC-Oak-Course

**MVC-Oak-Course** is a web application developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with C# and ASP.NET MVC. This project was created as part of my coursework to demonstrate my understanding of web development principles and the MVC design pattern.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The application is designed to display and manage training programs offered by Oak Academy. It features a layered architecture, including:

- **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Handles database interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Contains the business logic of the application.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Facilitates data transfer between layers.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Provides a responsive and interactive user experience.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: ASP.NET MVC
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Features

- **Course Management**: Admins can create, edit, and delete courses, assigning them to categories and adding metadata.
- **Admin Panel**: A secure area for administrators to manage courses and users.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth user experience.
